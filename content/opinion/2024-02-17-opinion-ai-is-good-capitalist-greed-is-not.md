title: "Opinion: AI is Good, Capitalist Greed is Not"
description: With the recent advancements we've seen with large language models,
  artificial intelligence has become a very polarizing subject. I believe we
  should be wary of fear mongering about technological advancements, and instead
  put the blame squarely word belongs.

# The AI Gold Rush
OpenAI recently announced Sora: a generative AI model that produces video from text provided by a user. Many have marveled at its potential to revolutionize film making. Cognition Labs recently introduced Devin, an ai model they are touting as "the first AI software engineer." Devin has demonstrated impressive capabilities in building, and debugging code bases. By now we're all familiar with large language models such as ChatGPT (also developed by OpenAI), Gemini by Google, and Copilot by Microsoft. Conversational models that boast the potential to replace search engines as our tool of choice for researching on the Internet.

We are in the midst of what I have taken to calling the "AI Gold Rush." Advancements in machine learning in recent years, generative AI especially, have opened the door for countless use cases and product ideas; And it seems that every companies is taking a stab at figuring out how artificial intelligence fits into their business. There is very clearly immense excitement at the potential for AI to exponentially increase productivity and subsequently profit.
# The Pushback 
But at what cost does that productivity come at? The conversation around AI is not all optimism and positivity however. There are very real concerns being raised around ethical practices in building and utilizing these machine learning systems, and who these systems can negatively impact.

Let's start with the data collection. Machine learning models learn from massive amounts  human generated content. It's a universal truth of every branch of machine learning, from Neural Networks, to decision trees, to reinforcement learning. The data is very often unethically sourced however. ChatGPT for example, which is trained on an open source data set of text collected from websites all across the internet called the [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/). While the Common Crawl is open source, it hosts a lot of copyrighted content. The New York Times actually [had some of their paywalled content removed](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-times-content-removed-common-crawl-ai-training-dataset-2023-11) from the data set. But ChatGPT has already been trained on this data, and is now a commercial product which stands to be extremely profitable. And all without the consent of the producers of this intellectual property.

And when these machine learning systems are unethically trained with intellectual property belonging to working professionals, who will now have to compete with said systems for work, it creates a very legitimate reason to oppose their very existence. There is very real anxiety around AI eliminating careers people have dedicated years specializing into, and depend on to make a living for themselves and their families. I've seen many software engineers question whether Devin spells the end of the line for them. 

There is also the issue of deepfakes.
# The Root of the Problem 
There is a reoccurring theme with all the criticisms of AI.
# The Potential for Good 
I am a firm believer that machine learning, and more broadly artificial intelligence, has immense potential for good in our world.

# The Need for Community 
AI is for the people.
