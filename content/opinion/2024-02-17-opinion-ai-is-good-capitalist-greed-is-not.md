title: "Opinion: AI is Good, Capitalist Greed is Not"
description: With the recent advancements we've seen with large language models,
  artificial intelligence has become a very polarizing subject. I believe we
  should be wary of fear mongering about technological advancements, and instead
  put the blame squarely word belongs.

# The AI Gold Rush
OpenAI recently announced Sora: a generative AI model that produces video from text provided by a user. Many have marveled at its potential to revolutionize film making. Cognition Labs recently introduced Devin, an ai model they are touting as "the first AI software engineer." Devin has demonstrated impressive capabilities in building, and debugging code bases. By now we're all familiar with large language models such as ChatGPT (also developed by OpenAI), Gemini by Google, and Copilot by Microsoft. Conversational models that boast the potential to replace search engines as our tool of choice for researching on the Internet.

We are in the midst of what I have taken to calling the "AI Gold Rush." Advancements in machine learning in recent years have opened the door for countless use cases and product ideas, and it seems that every companies is taking a stab at figuring out how artificial intelligence fits into their business. There is very clearly immense excitement at the potential for ai to exponentially increase productivity and subsequently profit.
# The Pushback 
The conversation around AI is not all optimism and positivity however. There are very real concerns being raised around ethical practices in building and utilizing these machine learning systems, and who these systems can negatively impact.

Let's start with the data collection.

And when these machine learning systems are unethically trained with intellectual property Belonging to working professionals who will now have to compete with said systems for work, it creates a very legitimate reason to oppose their very existence.

There is also the very real fear of how machine learning systems can be weaponized against civilian populations, whether through surveillance or a far more militaristic use cases.
# The Root of the Problem 
There is a reoccurring theme with all the criticisms of AI.
# The Potential for Good 
I am a firm believer that machine learning, and more broadly artificial intelligence, has immense potential for good in our world.

AI is for the people.
