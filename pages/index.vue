          I'm Ralph. I am a quadriplegic wheelchair user, videogame nerd,
          basketball nerd, and slowly becoming a chess nerd ðŸ˜€. This website is
          my attempt at documenting all the things I'm working on.

        <h2 class="subtitle block">
          Professionally, I have been a software engineer for nearly 10 years,
          most of which has been spent working with Android. I also do web
          development with this website made with Nuxt 3 and NetlifyCMS being
          one example.
